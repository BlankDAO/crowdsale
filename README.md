# Blank Token

It is an ERC-20 token with 18 decimals that is created by Blank Minter. Ethereum Blockchains hosts Blank Tokens during the genesis period. Once Blank ledger is released, all Blank Tokens created so far will be exchanged by BlankDAO native tokens one by one.

# Blank Minter

It is the smart contract that mints and transfers Blank Tokens to BlankDAO every 10 minutes continuously since the genesis point until the supply reaches 21M tokens. 

Blank Minter is designed with a supply growth model very similar to Bitcoinâ€™s. At genesis point the smart contract starts minting 50 tokens every 10 minutes. Once half the supply is minted (In approximately 4 years), the number of tokens minted in every interval halves to 25. And so on.

# Blank Crowdsale

BlankDAO sells Blank Tokens minted in Blank Minter through Blank Crowdsale smart contract. Tokens are sold in DAI. The price of Blank Tokens is set by the DAO. The minimum price for the crowdsale is 1 DAI. 

Requests for buying Blanktokens with less than 1 or more than 10K DAI are not accepted. Requests fors Blank Tokens with more than 10K DAI should be sent separately in smaller portions. 

To buy Blank Tokens directly from Crowdsale smart contract, buyers are required to provide refference codes that they receive from BlankDAO representatives.
