A crowdsale for Blank DAO's tokens

- BlankDAO Crowdsale features a simple smart contract to sell BlankTokens in return for DAI tokens.

- At genesis point, BlankTokens are ERC-20 and their supply is limited to 21 million. Once BlankLedger is released, the tokens will be exchanged by BlankDAO native tokens one by one. 

- The supply growth of BlankTokens is similar to Bitcoin. In the first 4 years, 50 tokens are minted every 10 minutes. The number of minted BlankTokens will half every four years from then on.

- BlankTokens are initially minted and sold through the Crowdsale smart contract.

- The price starts at 0.1 DAI and rises 1% in each 10-minute interval if all previously minted tokens are sold out.

- The minting process continues no matter the previously minted tokens are sold are not. 

- In case the minted tokens are not completely sold out, remaining available tokens are saved in the Crowdsale smart contract to be sold at a fixed price, halting the 1% price rise until no more tokens are available for sale on the Crowdsale.

- At any point in time, there might be people who, for whatever reason, would like to sell their purchased tokens at a lower price than the halted price in the Crowdsale. Accordingly, thereâ€™s an exchange suggested on BlankDAO that makes it possible for holders to sell their tokens at the price of their choosing.
